Day 3:
======
	Different types of members of a class.
		Data Members:
		-------------
			Class Member:
				One copy per class ---> using static keyword.

				Object/Instance/Variable Member:
					Each object has its own copy
						normal data members without any keyword
						const data members using const keyword
						mutable data members using mutable keyword
				
				Let me give you an example:
				Example: class Employee

class Array{
	int arr[SIZE];
	const int size;
public:
	Array(int = 0);
	Array(int sz, int first);

	void fillArray(int first);
	void printArray();
};

After this:
-----------

	const member functions and const objects
	mutable and static members
	dynamic memory allocation in C++.

	Introduction to Operator overloading 

==========================================================

Discussion on const keyword:
---------------------------

refer to file "employeeThree.cpp"

Using const keyword with objects:
--------------------------------

const objects will only allow constant functions to be called.
also constant objects will not allow class variables to be modified.
Only when you use mutable with a class variable, 
then const objects will allow modification of that variable
	
Using static keywords:
---------------------

static members belong to the class instead of the object.
