========================================================

Inheritance is a "is a" relationship:

========================================================

Multiple inheritance is not real inheritance since,
 child classes are not "specializing"
C++ supports multiple inheritance, since it promotes reusability,
Java does not and instead uses interfaces.

==========================================================

Due to multiple inheritance, there can be some ambiguities.
Like for example when two parent classes have same function.
This can be eliminated by using scope resolution operator.

============================================================

Diamond problem:

		B
	/		\
	B1		B2
	\		/
		D

Class D is inheriting class B twice.
This will cause two copies of data and methods to be present inside class D.
This is where virtual pointer comes into play.
Virtual pointer helps us point to the same class. 

Whenever, virtual keyword is used, any ambiguities are resolved at runtime.



==========================================================

Quick talk on memory alignment and structure padding:

the structure takes the largest datatype and creates blocks of that memory size,
if other data types are small, they still fill that block
and wasted space is padded space.
This is done to increase read speed of structure.

if all data types in struct are same, there will be no padded space,
and all memory space in blocks gets occupied.

==========================================================

Polymorphism:
-------------

	overriding and virtual functions.

	see: 
	polymorphism.cpp
	polymorphismTwo.cpp
	polymorphismThree.cpp

============================================================

Runtime polymorphism:
----------------------

Function overloading is an example of compile time polymorphism.
Function overriding is runtime polymorphism.

In C++ every function in a class can be represented in a "V Table".
and it has a virtual pointer called "vptr".
Job of constructor is to initialize the V-Table and vptr.
All these internal initializations at compiler level is the job of construtor.

Whenever an object is created, a v-table is initialized.
Similarly, functions are also placed in v-table with some index position
and address.

See:
virtualFuns.cpp

Any class that has pure virtual functions are called abstract classes in C++.

for eg:
			Sort 
		/			\
	Bubble			Quick

Here, Sort class is a abstract class
and it has a pure virtual functions with syntax:
virtual void sort() = 0;

Exception Handling:
--------------------

	What are exceptions?
		Exceptiosn are runtime abnormal conditions/behaviour,
		that occurs when your program is executed.
		Example:
			wrong input	/ files opening

	Handling of Exception?
		Throwing or raising an exception is done using throw keyword.
		Handling of exceptions is done in try{}catch() block.
