Exception Safety classes/objects...
User defined exceptions
	heirarchy of user defined exception classes

======================================================

Modern C++ => C++11 onwards.

======================================================

creating pointer classes with wrapper classes:

see:
	exceptionSafetyOne.cpp
	exceptionSafetyTwo.cpp
	exceptionSafetyThree.cpp
	exceptionSafetyTwoSol.cpp
	exceptionSafetyPtr.cpp

Notice that in any of these programs we are not solving problem 
of dangling pointers, we are just handling allocation and deallocation
to avoid memory leaks.

these wrapper classes can be used to create:
	1.) shared_ptr<>()
		maintains a reference count to an object in heap
		when reference count becomes zero
		that memory gets deallocated.
	2.) unique_ptr<>()
	3.) weak_ptr<>()


Solutions to dangling pointer:
	1.) deep copy
		Implemented in C++ using copy constructors and 
		overloaded "=" operator which does deep copy.
	2.) shared ownership 
		Implemented in C++ using 
		shared_ptr<>() which uses reference count
	3.) single ownership / transfering the ownership. 
		Implemented in C++ using 
		unique_ptr<>() which maintains single/unique ownership.

How to create r-value references?

In modern C++, r-value references are also possible.

example:

l-value reference:
int& ref = x;

r-value reference:

int&& ref = 10;

int&& ref = fun();

Exception Safety classes/object...
Built-in exception classes
	There are two main categories of exception classes
	in C++:

	Logic errors:
		are errors that can be detected by reading the code.
		For eg: trying to divide by zero is a logic error.
	Runtime errors:
		are errors that cannot be detected by reading the code.
		For eg: trying to open a file that does not exist is a runtime error.

The following table shows some of the most common exception classes in C++:

Class				Description
===========================================================================
std::logic_error		Base class for all logic errors.
std::domain_error		Thrown when an invalid argument is passed to a function.
std::invalid_argument		Thrown when an invalid argument is passed to a function.
std::length_error		Thrown when an attempt is made to access 
				an element of an array that is out of bounds.
std::out_of_range		Thrown when an attempt is made to acces
				an element of an array that is out of bounds.
std::runtime_error		Base class for all runtime errors.
std::range_error		Thrown when an attempt is made to access an element
				of an array that is out of bounds.
std::overflow_error		Thrown when an attempt is made to perform an arithmetic operation
				that results in an overflow.
std::underflow_error		Thrown when an attempt is made to perform an arithmetic operation
				that results in an underflow.

User defined Exception classes in C++:
	hierarchy of user defined exception classes.

	UDExceptionTwo.cpp

IO Streams:

There are close to 22 classes based on I/O stream.
But instructor will discuss 8 main classes.

				IOS_base
					|
					IOS 
				/		\
			istream		ostream
				\		/
					iostream

cin is an object of istream class.
This also handles operator overloading of ">>".
It also has get functions like:
get(), getline(), etc there are plenty of get function likethese.

cout is an object of ostream class.
This also handles operator overloading of "<<".
It also has lot of put functions.

From these three classes like: istream, iostream and ostream
there are three file related classes that inherit them.
istream		iostream	ostream
	|			|			|
ifstream	fstream		ofstream

In this way there are 8 stream related classes.

Here some examples on iostream:

iosOne.cpp
iosTwo.cpp
iosThree.cpp

Generic Programming using Templates in C++:
-------------------------------------------

Generic programming is writing code irrespective of which datatype
we are dealing with.
Usually we do this when algorithms is same but datatypes can be different.
We can apply generic programming to functions as well as classes.
for eg:
fun(int)
fun(float)
fun(double)
fun(string)
and so on...

Class which uses generic programming is called generic class.

In addition to object oriented programming and functional programming,
C++ also supports generic programming.

Generic programming is implemented in
C++ using Templates and in Java using generics.
templates in C++ have their datatype in arguments inside <>
for eg:

template<datatype>
void fun(datatype va){
	// insert code here.
}

for more info on template functions,
see:
templateOne.cpp
templateTwo.cpp
templateThree.cpp
templateFour.cpp
templateSort.cpp

Instructor says that once you get enough experience in a company.
You will not be coding in software, you will be managing
other junior software engineers. 

================================================================

Using Templates in Class:

Template classes in C++ are also called generic class.

syntax:
template<datatype T>
class ClassName{
	T dataIdentifier;
public:
	T fun(T a){
		// insert code here
		return a;
	}
}

Test<int> obj(10);
Test<double> dobj(10.123);

see:
	templateClassOne.cpp	
	templateClassTwo.cpp

===================================================================

Standard Template Library (STL):

Some guy from HP created a template library.
Then Microsoft adopted it.
