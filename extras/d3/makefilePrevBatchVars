# notice how we are creating variables for almost everything,
# for targets, dependencies, options, etc.


# we can even create different variables for different compilers, just in case we need them.
# also notice how we are creating a variable for all object files
# by using "$(SOURCES:.c=.o)" we take names of all source files, 
# and replace extension ".c" with ".o"


# options for searching header files in current working directory for gcc C compiler
CFLAGS := -I .	

#for g++ C++ compiler
CXXFLAGS := -I .

CC := gcc

# we can create variables for all files like this:
#SOURCES := addAtBeg.c allocMem.c dispList.c mainTest.c
# or we can simply use wildcard like "*":

SOURCES = $(wildcard *.c)	# only change here

# notice that this will help create a variable for all files listed above.
# and its syntax is much more concise as you dont have to list all files by name
# as there could be more than hundred files that might need to be listed.

# concise way to create a variable with all object files:
OBJECTS := $(SOURCES:.c=.o)
EXECUTABLE := listExe

$(EXECUTABLE): $(OBJECTS)
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -o $@ $(OBJECTS)

.c.o: 
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c -o $@ $<

clean: 
	rm *.o listExe
