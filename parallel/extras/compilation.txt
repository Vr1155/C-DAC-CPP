	int x; 		// declaration
	int x = 100;	// definition

	// when you use extern keyword, its declaration only:
	extern int x;	// declaration only

	// This is because, compiler has something called:
	// ODR = One Definition Rule.


What is pre-processing?
	
	instructions to pre-processor
		OR
	preprocessor directives

	in C/C++ any statements starting with "#" is a preprocessor directive.
	in line: "#include <stdio.h>",
	include is the directive and stdio.h is the argument.

	what include does is include the contents of header file into our current program.
	please note that <> is for system headers and "" is for user defined headers.

	Other pre-processor directives:
	
	#define
	#ifndef
	#if
	#ifndef
	#else
	#endif
