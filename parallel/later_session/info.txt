Revision on Parallel Programming:

Parallel Computing, parallel processing or multiprocesssing is to enable 
or perform multiple tasks/programs to run simultaneously on multiple processors.

What we tend to do is by splitting a single task into multiple independent smaller or sub-tasks. 
Where each sub-tasks is nothing but set of instructions which 
can run simultaneously on different processors.

====================================================================================


race conditions..

	If the variable is one which is shared...
		each increment operation is not a single operation...
			read data
			add operation
			assign to data

		there is something called atomic operation...
			that is if you start performing any operation,
			you complete the whole operation in one go.

		C++ provides class for atomic operations
			for eg:
			atmoic<int> &counter;

====================================================================================
			

mutexes and semaphores:
	
	in C++ we have the following mutexes:

		-> unique_lock (with regular mutex)
		-> lock_guard
		-> rlock
		-> unique_lock (with timed mutex)

	to maintain consistency and integrity of shared data while multithreading.

MPI ---> Message Passsing Interface.
		is a library specification for message passing,
		which is a way/method of parallel processing an app/program by dividing the work
		between multiple - processors.

		MPI is one of the widely used standard for parallel programming.

		This library defines set of functions that can be used to
		send and recieve message/data between processors as well as manage the 
		parallel running or execution of program.
		MPI library is available in C, C++, FORTRAN, Python...

		Some of the widely used MPI library.
			Intel MPI Library
				is maintained by Intel which is optimized for Intel based processors.
				support available for windows, UNIX, Linux, macOS platforms.
			Open MPI
				Open Source MPI library ...
				support available for windows, UNIX, Linux, macOS platforms.
			MPICH
				Open Source MPI library ...
				support available for windows, unix, linux, macos platforms.
			Boost.MPI
				Open Source MPI library ...
				Boost is a collection of C++ libraries ...
				They also provide their version of MPI, 		
				support available for windows, unix, linux, macos platforms.
		header file:	
		#include <mpi>

		for compiling:
			g++ filename ...
			or 
			mpic++ or mpiCC

		for running ...
			mpirun on Linux 
			mpiexec on Windows

		in main ...
			MPI_Init() ;
				to start the MPI code ...
			
			MPI_Finalize();
				before ending the code ...

			MPI_Comm_rank(MPI_COMM_WORLD, &rank);	// rank of your processor

PASL ---> Parallel Algorithm Scheduling Library.

		PASL is a C++ library that allows programmars to write parallel programs.
		Its is based on fork-join parallelism model.

		$ cd pasl/example

		Then, build the binary for the source file, which is named 'fib.cpp'.
